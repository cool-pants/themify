# themify

A theme selector plugin on top of telescope. Heavily Inspired by
[vague2k/huez.nvim](https://github.com/vague2k/huez.nvim). Will be used till
some features are available in Huez.

# Demo

As seen below, once setup we can easily pull up a telescope menu to select the theme

# Setup

WIP. Due to recent Re-Write
